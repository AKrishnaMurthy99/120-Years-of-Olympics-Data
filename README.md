## Introduction

This project, titled **"Analyzing 120 Years of Olympic Data with SQL and Tableau"**, delves into a comprehensive analysis of over a century of Olympic Games data. By leveraging SQL for data querying and Tableau for visualization, the project aims to uncover significant patterns and trends in Olympic participation, sports, athlete achievements, and medal distribution.
